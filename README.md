# Labratorys
Lab tasks in different languages

There will be Python, Java and some C++ basic labs.

# Lab: Vectrors (java)
Mainly, it`s about vectors type, where i use three double for coordinate and few method, like length, angls, sum/diff. For usage coordinate will be method get and set

# Lab: Mask (python)
Shortly, it`s a lil part of my work, which wrote on C++, but rewrite on Python.
In input write positions of byte or bit in certain byte (write it with byte pos + dot + bite pos), or borders of positions, and program return dictiaonary with position and mask for it.
